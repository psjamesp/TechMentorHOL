"dbatools for Systems Engineers and Accidental DBAs","5/5","Chrissy delivered a ton of immediately useful information and was enthusiastic and engaging on the topic. My ONLY complaint is that the setup for remote presenters has their webcam in a tiny PIP window - it might be nice to have the webcam on a side TV a bit larger"
