"More Game Breaking PowerShell","4/5","Great job! So much cool stuff that I'm going to take back and use. My only criticism is having the integrated console so tiny vs just using an external pwsh window"

"More Game Breaking PowerShell","4/5","Your modules are awesome. I would have preferred if you dove into a couple of them to show more about how they work (on the cli, not the code) instead of trying to pack as many of them in as you could though. Looking forward to using them though."
"More Game Breaking PowerShell","4/5","Would have loved to see a deeper look at how some of that worked. You showed the code, but breaking out and explaining specific examples would have been helpful to the larger group."
