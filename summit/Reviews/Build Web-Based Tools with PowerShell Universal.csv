"Build Web-Based Tools with PowerShell Universal","5/5","Great intro to PSU, really looking forward to v3. Loved the Pages part, I hadn't had time to play with that yet and a good demo was exactly what I needed. You should mention next time that there is a free version for those who weren't familiar."
